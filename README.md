# weather-dashboard

This weather dashboard is an application that pulls current information from the OpenWeatherMap API. 
Your search is done by city name and will produce current weather conditions and a five day outlook. This UV index is also coded with colors to display the severity of the conditions when the search is made (ranging from green-good to red-severe).
